            <p>I am David Carrano. I am a professional Web
                Developer and Software Engineer currently residing in Shelton, CT. specializing in production efficiency
                with an eye for high quality product design and functionality. Innovative, enterprising and relentlessly
                driven towards a successful outcome for every goal. You can expect from me complete dedication to the
                task at hand and a willingness to work tirelessly to achieve goals. I collaborate well with others and
                can work very well independently on any development project. I have many years of experience in
                management, development, and design of web projects and have seen how technology changes over time and I
                have learned the valuable skill of constantly learning new technologies as they arise. I also have a
                strong understanding of how and when to incorporate new tech as well as how to make a strong impact with
                simple solutions. I believe my most valuable asset is my strong ability to create innovative solutions
                to complex problems and my commitment to success.
